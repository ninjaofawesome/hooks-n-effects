# [Hooks n' Effects](http://hereshannahs.info/hooks-n-effects): A project about hooks and effects in React

##What is this?

This project is a learning project for me to try using Hooks and Effects in React in a reference format.  It features Styled Components and will be fully tested with Jest and Enzyme.  More details to come soon, but check the project board [here](https://trello.com/b/tx5XgBDo/hooks-n-effect) to see where I'm at!

##How I did it

Mostly I built Row components with each type of hook or effect that I wanted to try.  In each row, I tried to show the hooked way followed by the usual way that I've done things since forever.

##Challenges

None really.  It was great to learn to use effects.  I can see when I'd prefer to use them and where I'm OK with using things locally such as `setState` or something like that. 

##What was great about this project

See challenges!
