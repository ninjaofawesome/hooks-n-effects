#Hooks n' Effects: A project about hooks and effects in React

##What is this?

This project is a learning project for me to try using Hooks and Effects in React in a reference format.  It features Styled Components and will be fully tested with Jest and Enzyme.  More details to come soon, but check the project board [here](https://trello.com/b/tx5XgBDo/hooks-n-effect) to see where I'm at!
